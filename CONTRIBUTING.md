# Contributing to DevOps Cases

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **inview‑club/devops-cases**! 🎉  
This project is a collection of DevOps cases for learning, and we welcome submissions of new solutions, enhancements, and improvements.

Please read through this document to understand how best to contribute.

## ✅ What kinds of contributions are welcome

- **Submitting a solution** to a case (your implementation, scripts, tooling, documentation, etc.)    
- **Adding new cases** or challenges (with problem statement, constraints, tests or validation)  

Contributions that are thoughtful, well-documented, and easy to understand will be much easier to accept.

## How to submit a solution on GitHub

Each case folder has a `solutions` subdirectory where you can add your solution and get feedback by creating a pull request.

1. Fork the repo to your profile.
2. Add your solution inside the `solutions` folder for the case:
   1. Make sure to include a `README.md` that explains your solution and how to reproduce it. It doesn’t have to be long — just write something!
   2. It’s best if your `README.md` is in English, but it’s not required. You can also add files in other languages, like `README-ru.md`.
   3. Feel free to include any other files that will help others understand and test your solution.
3. Create a pull request.

That’s all! Your pull request counts as your solution submission. We’ll give you feedback, and if everything looks good, your solution will be merged and shared with the community.
