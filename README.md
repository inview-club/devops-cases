# 💼 Inview Club Cases 💼

## 👉 What's this?

Problems, tasks, and ideas we have encountered through our experience working as DevOps engineers.

All our cases can be implemented locally, requiring only time and the ability to google. They will serve as good practice for your resumes and knowledge and can be useful for talking about yourself in interviews.

## 👨‍💻 Current cases

## How to submit a solution on GitHub

Each case folder has a `solutions` subdirectory where you can add your solution and get feedback by creating a pull request.

1. Fork the repo to your profile.
2. Add your solution inside the `solutions` folder for the case:
   1. Make sure to include a `README.md` that explains your solution and how to reproduce it. It doesn’t have to be long — just write something!
   2. It’s best if your `README.md` is in English, but it’s not required. You can also add files in other languages, like `README-ru.md`.
   3. Feel free to include any other files that will help others understand and test your solution.
3. Create a pull request.

That’s all! Your pull request counts as your solution submission. We’ll give you feedback, and if everything looks good, your solution will be merged and shared with the community.
